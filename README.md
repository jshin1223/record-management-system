The Record Management System is a Python-based desktop application designed for a specialist travel agency to manage three types of records:
1. **Client Records**
2. **Airline Records**
3. **Flight Records**

The system comes with an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) to add, modify, search and remove records.
