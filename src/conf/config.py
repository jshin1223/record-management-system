"""
This module configures file paths and settings for the Record Management System.

It provides:
- Paths for storing client, airline, and flight data in JSON files.
- GUI settings such as window title and size.
- Debugging options to print paths for verification.

Attributes:
    BASE_DIR (str): The directory containing this config file.
    DATA_DIR (str): The directory where data files are stored.
    CLIENT_FILE (str): Path to the file storing client records.
    AIRLINE_FILE (str): Path to the file storing airline records.
    FLIGHT_FILE (str): Path to the file storing flight records.
    WINDOW_TITLE (str): Title of the application window.
    WINDOW_SIZE (str): Size of the application window (width x height).
